# Chapter 5: Learning Objectives

We've talked about the AI "brain" and the robot "body." But how does the brain's high-level decision get translated into the low-level motor commands that create smooth, stable movement? The answer lies in control systems.

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Define a Control System:** Explain the purpose of a control system in a robot and describe its main components: the setpoint, the process variable, the controller, and the actuator.
- **Distinguish Between Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Control:** Clearly explain the difference between these two fundamental types of control and why closed-loop is essential for robotics.
- **Understand Feedback:** Grasp the concept of "feedback" and its critical role in helping a robot correct errors and adapt to the real world.
- **Explain PID Control:** Describe the three components (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) of a PID controller, the most common type of feedback controller in robotics.
- **Recognize Hierarchical Control:** Understand the concept of hierarchical control, where high-level AI decisions are broken down into low-level motor commands.
- **Connect Control Systems to AI:** See how modern AI and classical control theory work together to create intelligent and capable robots.
