# Chapter 5: Assessment Questions

Test your understanding of the principles of control systems.

### Multiple Choice

1.  **What is the primary advantage of a closed-loop control system over an open-loop system?**
    a)  It is simpler and cheaper to build.
    b)  It uses less power.
    c)  It can use feedback to correct for errors.
    d)  It does not require sensors.

2.  **In a feedback control system, what is the "error"?**
    a)  A malfunction in a motor.
    b)  The power consumed by the system.
    c)  The difference between the desired state (setpoint) and the measured state (process variable).
    d)  The time it takes for a command to execute.

3.  **The "D" term in a PID controller helps to:**
    a)  Eliminate small, steady-state errors.
    b)  Increase the overall power of the system.
    c)  React in proportion to the current error.
    d)  Dampen oscillations and prevent overshoot by anticipating the error's future trend.

4.  **In a humanoid robot's hierarchical control system, which layer is responsible for making the strategic decision to "walk to the door"?**
    a)  The low-level PID controller.
    b)  The mid-level motion planner.
    c)  The high-level AI.
    d)  The power system.

### True or False

1.  **A system that uses feedback is called an "open-loop" system.** (True / False)
2.  **The "P" in PID control stands for "Power".** (True / False)
3.  **A thermostat is a common real-world example of a closed-loop control system.** (True / False)

### Short Answer

1.  You are trying to control a robot's arm, but it keeps oscillating and overshooting its target position. Which term in your PID controller (P, I, or D) would be most useful for fixing this problem, and why?
2.  Briefly explain the different roles of the high-level AI, the mid-level motion planner, and the low-level PID controllers in a hierarchical control system.
