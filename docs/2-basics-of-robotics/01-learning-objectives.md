# Chapter 2: Learning Objectives

Welcome to the second chapter! Now that we understand what Physical AI is, it's time to zoom in on the "body" part of the equation. In this chapter, you'll learn the fundamentals of robotics.

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Define a Robot:** Explain the three key characteristics that define a robot: the ability to sense, process, and act.
- **Identify Robot Components:** Name and describe the main hardware components of a robot, including the frame, power source, sensors, actuators, and controller.
- **Understand Degrees of Freedom:** Grasp the concept of "Degrees of Freedom" (DoF) and explain how it relates to a robot's ability to move.
- **Differentiate Robot Locomotion:** Describe different ways robots can move, such as using wheels, legs, or propellers.
- **Recognize Common Robot Designs:** Identify common robot configurations like robotic arms and mobile robots.
- **Explain Kinematics:** Understand the basic idea of kinematics and why it's important for controlling robot movement.
