# Chapter 2: Assessment Questions

Let's test your knowledge of the fundamental concepts of robotics.

### Multiple Choice

1.  **The three core functions of a robot are often described by the loop:**
    a)  Input -> Output -> Power
    b)  Move -> Stop -> Repeat
    c)  Sense -> Process -> Act
    d)  Learn -> Forget -> Relearn

2.  **What is the "end-effector" of a robot?**
    a)  The robot's power source.
    b)  The computer that controls the robot.
    c)  The last command in the robot's program.
    d)  The tool at the end of a robotic arm, like a gripper.

3.  **A robot's ability to move is described by its:**
    a)  Kinematics
    b)  Degrees of Freedom (DoF)
    c)  Chassis
    d)  Power level

4.  **Which type of locomotion is most efficient on flat, smooth surfaces?**
    a)  Legged
    b)  Wheeled
    c)  Aerial
    d)  Swimming

### True or False

1.  **A simple toaster is considered a robot because it acts on its environment (it toasts bread).** (True / False)
2.  **"Forward Kinematics" is the problem of figuring out the required joint angles to reach a specific point in space.** (True / False)
3.  **A robot's controller is responsible for powering the actuators.** (True / False)

### Short Answer

1.  Name the five main hardware components of a typical robot.
2.  You want to design a robot that can place a book on a specific shelf. Which type of kinematics (Forward or Inverse) would you need to solve to do this? Explain why.

### *Answers*
*   **Multiple Choice:** 1(c), 2(d), 3(b), 4(b)
*   **True or False:** 1(False - it cannot sense or process), 2(False - that is Inverse Kinematics), 3(False - the controller sends signals, the power source provides power)
