# Chapter 2: Chapter Summary

Great work! You've now covered the essential concepts of robotics, the physical foundation of any Physical AI system. Let's recap what we learned.

### Key Takeaways

-   **The Definition of a Robot:** A true robot operates on a **Sense-Process-Act** loop. It must be able to gather information about its world (sense), make a decision (process), and then do something (act).

-   **Core Components:** We broke down the robot into its five main hardware parts:
    -   **Frame:** The skeleton.
    -   **Controller:** The brain/nervous system.
    -   **Power Source:** The energy supply.
    -   **Sensors:** The senses.
    -   **Actuators:** The muscles.

-   **Degrees of Freedom (DoF):** This important concept describes a robot's agility. Every independent way a robot can move adds a Degree of Freedom. More DoF means more complex movement is possible.

-   **Locomotion:** We looked at the main ways robots get around:
    -   **Wheeled:** Fast and efficient on flat ground.
    -   **Legged:** Great for complex, uneven terrain.
    -   **Aerial:** Provides freedom of movement in 3D space.

-   **Kinematics is Key to Control:** We introduced the idea of kinematics, which is the math that links the robot's joint angles to the position of its end-effector.
    -   **Forward Kinematics:** Joint angles -> Hand position.
    -   **Inverse Kinematics:** Hand position -> Joint angles. (This is the hard but more useful one).

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of a Physical AI having a "brain" and a "body." In this chapter, we've built a solid understanding of what that "body" is made of and how it moves.

Next, we'll dive into **Chapter 3: Sensors and Actuators**, where we will explore the "senses" and "muscles" of the robot in much more detail.
