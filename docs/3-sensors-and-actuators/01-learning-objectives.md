# Chapter 3: Learning Objectives

Welcome to Chapter 3! We've covered the "brain" (AI) and the "body" (robotics). Now, let's get into the nitty-gritty of how a robot senses and moves. This chapter is all about the "senses" and "muscles" of our robot.

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Distinguish Between Sensors and Actuators:** Clearly explain the different roles of sensors (inputs) and actuators (outputs) in a robot.
- **Categorize Different Sensor Types:** Identify and describe common robot sensors, including proprioceptive (internal) and exteroceptive (external) sensors.
- **Explain Common Sensor Technologies:** Understand how basic sensors like cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, and force-torque sensors work.
- **Describe Different Actuator Types:** Name and explain the function of common actuators, including electric motors (DC, Servo, Stepper) and hydraulic/pneumatic systems.
- **Understand the Importance of Sensor Fusion:** Grasp the concept of "sensor fusion" and why combining data from multiple sensors is crucial for robust performance.
- **Connect Sensors and Actuators to the Sense-Process-Act Loop:** Explain how sensors provide the "Sense" and actuators provide the "Act" in the fundamental loop of robotics.
