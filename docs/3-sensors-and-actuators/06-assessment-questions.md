# Chapter 3: Assessment Questions

Test your understanding of how robots sense and act.

### Multiple Choice

1.  **Which of the following is the best description of a sensor?**
    a)  A motor that creates movement.
    b)  A device that converts a physical property into an electrical signal.
    c)  The "brain" of the robot.
    d)  The physical frame of the robot.

2.  **A LiDAR sensor is used to:**
    a)  Measure the robot's internal temperature.
    b)  Measure distances by using laser light.
    c)  Recognize human speech.
    d)  Measure the force of a grip.

3.  **Which type of motor is best suited for moving a robot's arm to a specific angle and holding it there?**
    a)  DC Motor
    b)  Pneumatic Motor
    c)  Stepper Motor
    d)  Servo Motor

4.  **Sensor fusion is the process of:**
    a)  Combining data from multiple sensors to get a more reliable result.
    b)  Replacing a broken sensor with a new one.
    c)  Using one sensor for many different tasks.
    d)  Converting sensor data into motion.

### True or False

1.  **An IMU is an exteroceptive sensor.** (True / False)
2.  **Actuators are the "muscles" of a robot.** (True / False)
3.  **A camera provides data that is generally easier for a computer to process than LiDAR data.** (True / False)

### Short Answer

1.  What is the difference between a proprioceptive and an exteroceptive sensor? Give one example of each.
2.  You are building a robot that needs to navigate a dark room. Would a camera or a LiDAR be a better choice for the primary navigation sensor? Explain your reasoning.

### *Answers*
*   **Multiple Choice:** 1(b), 2(b), 3(d), 4(a)
*   **True or False:** 1(False - it measures the robot's own internal state of motion), 2(True), 3(False - raw 3D point cloud data is often simpler than interpreting a 2D image)
