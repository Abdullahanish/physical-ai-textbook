# Chapter 6: Learning Objectives

We have arrived at the top of the control hierarchy: the "brain" of the robot. This chapter focuses on the Artificial Intelligence that makes the high-level decisions, turning a machine that just follows commands into an agent that can think and act on its own.

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Define an AI Agent:** Explain what an AI agent is and how it relates to a physical robot, using the perception-action loop.
- **Describe Different Agent Architectures:** Understand and contrast different ways to design an agent's "brain," such as simple reflex agents, model-based agents, and learning agents.
- **Explain the Role of Machine Learning:** Discuss how machine learning, especially reinforcement learning, is used to teach robots complex behaviors.
- **Understand Reinforcement Learning:** Grasp the basic concepts of Reinforcement Learning (RL), including agent, environment, state, action, and reward.
- **Define a "Policy":** Explain what a "policy" is in the context of RL and how it acts as the robot's brain.
- **Recognize the Importance of State Estimation:** Discuss the challenge of "state estimation" and why a robot needs to know both its own state and the state of the world around it to make good decisions.
