# Chapter 6: Exercises

Let's think about how an AI agent makes decisions.

### Exercise 1: Define the RL Problem

You want to use Reinforcement Learning to train a simple AI agent to win at the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Define the components of the RL problem:

-   **Environment:** _________________________
-   **Agent:** _________________________
-   **State:** _________________________
-   **Actions:** _________________________
-   **Reward:** How would you define the reward signal? (Think about winning, losing, and drawing).
    ________________________________________________________________

### Exercise 2: Agent Architectures

For each of the following tasks, which agent architecture would be most appropriate: a **Simple Reflex Agent**, a **Model-Based Agent**, or a **Learning Agent**? Explain your choice.

1.  **Task: The controller for a smart thermostat.** Its only job is to turn the heat on when the temperature is below the setpoint and turn it off when it's above.
    -   **Architecture:** _________________________
    -   **Reasoning:** _________________________________________________

2.  **Task: An AI to play chess.** The agent needs to think several moves ahead to beat its opponent.
    -   **Architecture:** _________________________
    -   **Reasoning:** _________________________________________________

3.  **Task: An AI to control a humanoid robot learning to ride a bicycle.** The physics of riding a bike are incredibly complex and hard to program by hand.
    -   **Architecture:** _________________________
    -   **Reasoning:** _________________________________________________

### Exercise 3: The Perception-Action Loop

Describe the perception-action loop for a self-driving car that is approaching a traffic light.

1.  **Perceive:** What does the agent sense from its environment?
2.  **Think:** What is the agent's brain (the policy) doing? What decision does it need to make?
3.  **Act:** What action does the agent take?
4.  **Loop:** How does this action change the environment and lead to the next perception?
