# Chapter 6: Assessment Questions

Test your knowledge of how AI agents power intelligent robots.

### Multiple Choice

1.  **In Reinforcement Learning, what is the agent's primary goal?**
    a)  To perform actions as quickly as possible.
    b)  To build a perfect model of the environment.
    c)  To maximize the cumulative reward it receives over time.
    d)  To follow its pre-programmed instructions perfectly.

2.  **A "policy" in the context of an AI agent is:**
    a)  A set of rules about what the robot is not allowed to do.
    b)  The hardware that the AI runs on.
    c)  A strategy that maps a state to an action.
    d)  The reward signal the agent receives.

3.  **A simple Roomba vacuum cleaner that just reverses and turns when it hits a wall is best described as a:**
    a)  Learning Agent
    b)  Model-Based Agent
    c)  Simple Reflex Agent
    d)  Humanoid Agent

4.  **Why is training a robot in a simulation often preferred over training in the real world?**
    a)  Because robots in simulation can learn instantly.
    b)  Because real-world sensors are not accurate enough for learning.
    c)  Because in a simulation, actions are faster and crashing is "free."
    d)  Because simulations have better graphics.

### True or False

1.  **A robot agent always has perfect knowledge of the true state of the world.** (True / False)
2.  **Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns through trial and error.** (True / False)
3.  **A model-based agent can predict the outcome of its actions before it takes them.** (True / False)

### Short Answer

1.  What are the five core components of a Reinforcement Learning problem?
2.  What is "state estimation" and why is it a necessary challenge for robots operating in the real world?

### *Answers*
*   **Multiple Choice:** 1(c), 2(c), 3(c), 4(c)
*   **True or False:** 1(False - it only has its own belief state based on noisy sensors), 2(True), 3(True)
