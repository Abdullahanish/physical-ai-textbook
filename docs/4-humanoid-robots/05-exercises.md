# Chapter 4: Exercises

Let's think more deeply about the unique challenges of humanoid robotics.

### Exercise 1: The Uncanny Valley

1.  Do a quick web search for images or videos of the following robots:
    -   **Roomba** (a disc-shaped vacuum)
    -   **Pepper** (a social humanoid robot)
    -   **Geminoid** (a highly realistic android)

2.  For each robot, write down your immediate emotional reaction. Do you find it useful, cute, creepy, or something else?

3.  Based on your reactions, where would you place each of these robots on the Uncanny Valley graph?

    -   **Roomba:** _________________________
    -   **Pepper:** _________________________
    -   **Geminoid:** _________________________

### Exercise 2: Why Humanoid?

For the following tasks, would a humanoid robot be a good choice? Or would a different kind of robot (e.g., wheeled, drone, robotic arm) be better? Explain your reasoning.

1.  **Task: Assembling a smartphone in a factory.**
    -   **Humanoid or Other?** _________________________
    -   **Reasoning:** _________________________________________________

2.  **Task: Assisting a firefighter by carrying heavy equipment and opening doors inside a burning building.**
    -   **Humanoid or Other?** _________________________
    -   **Reasoning:** _________________________________________________

3.  **Task: Exploring the surface of Mars.**
    -   **Humanoid or Other?** _________________________
    -   **Reasoning:** _________________________________________________

### Exercise 3: The ZMP in Your Life

You can feel the Zero Moment Point in your own body.

1.  Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. Your body is easily balancing. Your ZMP is somewhere in the middle of your support polygon (the area between your feet).
2.  Now, lift one foot off the ground. What did your body have to do *immediately* before you could lift your foot? (Hint: Think about where your hips and upper body moved).
3.  **Explain what you did in terms of the ZMP and your support polygon.**
