# Chapter 4: Key Concepts

This chapter deals with the unique concepts and challenges related to building robots in our own image.

- **Humanoid Robot:** A robot with a body plan built to resemble the human body. Typically, this means a head, a torso, two arms, and two legs.

- **Anthropomorphism:** The tendency to attribute human traits, emotions, and intentions to non-human entities. This is a powerful psychological effect that makes us interact with humanoid robots differently than with other machines.

- **Uncanny Valley:** A concept in aesthetics which holds that when a robot looks and moves almost, but not perfectly, like a natural human being, it causes a feeling of unease or revulsion (the "valley").

- **Bipedal Locomotion:** The act of moving by means of two rear limbs or legs. This is the technical term for "walking on two legs," and it is an extremely difficult problem in robotics.

- **Zero Moment Point (ZMP):** A key concept in the control of walking robots. The ZMP is the point on the ground where the total forces acting on the robot balance out perfectly, so it doesn't tip over. To walk stably, a robot's controller must constantly calculate and control the position of the ZMP to keep it within the support polygon (the area under its feet).

- **Dexterous Manipulation:** The ability to use hands to grasp and handle objects with skill and precision, just as a human does. Replicating the dexterity of the human hand is often considered one of the ultimate challenges in robotics.

- **Degrees of Freedom (DoF) in Humanoids:** Humanoid robots are defined by their extremely high number of Degrees of Freedom. A human has over 200 DoF. Advanced humanoid robots may have 30-50 DoF, which makes them incredibly flexible but also incredibly complex to control.

- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** A field of study dedicated to understanding, designing, and evaluating robotic systems for use by or with humans. The humanoid form is of special interest in HRI because it can make interactions feel more natural.
