# Chapter 4: Real-World Examples

While fully functional humanoid robots like you see in the movies are not yet a reality, there are several famous research platforms and emerging commercial robots that showcase the current state of the art.

### 1. Atlas by Boston Dynamics

- **What it is:** Atlas is arguably the most advanced humanoid robot in the world in terms of mobility and agility. It is a research platform designed to push the limits of whole-body mobility.
- **Humanoid Concepts in Action:**
    - **Bipedal Locomotion:** Atlas is famous for its ability to run, jump, and even do backflips. This demonstrates an incredible mastery of dynamic balance. Its controller performs complex ZMP calculations in real-time to allow for these explosive movements.
    - **High Degrees of Freedom:** Atlas has 28 DoF, giving it a huge range of motion. It uses its arms and torso to balance itself while running and jumping, much like a human athlete does.
    - **Actuation:** It is powered by a very powerful and compact hydraulic system, which is what allows it to perform such fast and powerful movements.

### 2. Digit by Agility Robotics

- **What it is:** Digit is a humanoid robot designed specifically for logistics and package delivery. Unlike Atlas, it is being developed as a commercial product.
- **Humanoid Concepts in Action:**
    - **Designed for a Human World:** Digit's purpose is to work alongside people in warehouses and to carry packages from a delivery van to your front door. Its humanoid form allows it to navigate stairs and sidewalks.
    - **Efficient Bipedalism:** Digit's legs are designed to be very efficient. Its "bird-like" leg structure and careful balance control allow it to operate for long periods on a single battery charge.
    - **Simple Manipulation:** Instead of complex hands, Digit has simple grippers. This is a practical design choice: it only needs to be able to hold a box, not perform complex manipulation tasks. This makes it simpler, cheaper, and more reliable.

### 3. Pepper by SoftBank Robotics

- **What it is:** Pepper is a social humanoid robot designed for human interaction. It's not meant for heavy lifting or running but for engaging with people in places like airports, banks, and stores.
- **Humanoid Concepts in Action:**
    - **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI):** Pepper's entire design is focused on HRI. Its head, arms, and expressive gestures are all meant to communicate in a way that feels natural to people.
    - **Avoiding the Uncanny Valley:** Pepper is intentionally designed to look like a friendly, non-threatening robot, not a realistic person. Its large eyes, smooth white body, and tablet on its chest clearly signal that it is a machine, which helps people feel more comfortable interacting with it.
    - **Sensors for Social Cues:** Pepper is equipped with microphones, cameras, and touch sensors that its AI uses to detect a person's presence, direction of gaze, and even emotional state (based on tone of voice), so it can modify its behavior accordingly.
