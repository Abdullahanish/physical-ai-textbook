# Chapter 4: Assessment Questions

Let's see what you've learned about the specific challenges of humanoid robots.

### Multiple Choice

1.  **What is the primary reason for designing robots with a humanoid form?**
    a)  Because it is the easiest type of robot to build.
    b)  So they can operate effectively in environments built for humans.
    c)  Because they are more energy-efficient than wheeled robots.
    d)  To make them better at high-speed calculations.

2.  **The "Uncanny Valley" describes:**
    a)  A place where many robots are built.
    b)  A feeling of unease caused by a robot that is almost, but not perfectly, human-like.
    c)  The difficulty a robot has in seeing objects in a valley.
    d)  The optimal point of balance for a walking robot.

3.  **The Zero Moment Point (ZMP) is a critical concept for which of the following challenges?**
    a)  Understanding human speech.
    b)  Dexterous manipulation.
    c)  Bipedal locomotion.
    d)  Recognizing objects with a camera.

4.  **"Dexterous manipulation" refers to a robot's ability to:**
    a)  Walk on two legs.
    b)  Solve complex math problems.
    c)  Use hands to grasp and handle objects with skill.
    d)  See in the dark.

### True or False

1.  **Bipedal locomotion is considered one of the easiest problems to solve in robotics.** (True / False)
2.  **A robot must keep its ZMP inside its support polygon to avoid falling over.** (True / False)
3.  **The humanoid robot "Atlas" is primarily designed for social interaction in stores and banks.** (True / False)

### Short Answer

1.  What are the two "grand challenges" of humanoid robotics that we discussed in this chapter?
2.  You are designing a social robot that will interact with children in a hospital. How would your knowledge of the Uncanny Valley influence your robot's design?
