# Chapter 1: Key Concepts

This chapter introduces foundational ideas that will build the basis for everything else we learn in this book. Here are the key concepts you need to know:

- **Physical AI:** This is a type of Artificial Intelligence that has a physical body and can interact with the world. Think of a robot that can walk, talk, and pick things up, not just a chatbot on a screen. Its intelligence is "embodied."

- **Embodiment:** This is the idea that an AI's intelligence is shaped by its physical form. A robot with wheels will "think" about the world differently than a robot with legs. The body and brain are deeply connected.

- **Agent:** In AI, an "agent" is anything that can perceive its environment and take actions to achieve a goal. A Physical AI is an agent with a body.

- **Environment:** This is the world that the AI agent operates in. For a self-driving car, the environment is the road, other cars, and pedestrians. For a household robot, it's your home.

- **Sensors:** These are the parts of a robot that allow it to "sense" the world. They are like our own senses. Examples include cameras (sight), microphones (hearing), and touch sensors (touch).

- **Actuators:** These are the parts of a robot that allow it to "act" or move. Motors in the joints of a robot arm are actuators. They turn electrical energy into physical motion.

- **Humanoid Robot:** A robot that is designed to look and move like a human. Humanoid robots have a head, torso, two arms, and two legs. This design helps them operate in environments built for people.
