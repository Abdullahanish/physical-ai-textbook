# Chapter 1: Exercises

Doing exercises is one of the best ways to make sure you understand the key concepts. Try these out to test your knowledge!

### Exercise 1: Identify the Parts

For each of the robots below, try to identify the **brain**, the **body**, the **sensors**, and the **actuators**.

1.  **A Roomba (robotic vacuum cleaner):**
    -   **Brain:** _________________________
    -   **Body:** _________________________
    -   **Sensors:** _________________________
    -   **Actuators:** _________________________

2.  **A Mars Rover (like NASA's *Perseverance*):**
    -   **Brain:** _________________________
    -   **Body:** _________________________
    -   **Sensors:** _________________________
    -   **Actuators:** _________________________

### Exercise 2: Brainstorming a New Robot

Imagine you are an engineer tasked with designing a robot to help elderly people live independently at home.

1.  **What tasks would you want your robot to do?** (e.g., remind them to take medicine, help them get up from a chair, fetch a glass of water).
2.  **What kind of body would it need?** (e.g., Does it need wheels or legs? Arms? Hands?)
3.  **What sensors would be most important for it to have?** (e.g., camera, microphone, touch sensors).
4.  **What is one major challenge you think you would face in designing this robot?**

### Exercise 3: Embodiment in Your Life

The idea of embodiment says that our physical body shapes our intelligence. Think about a skill you have learned in your own life (e.g., playing a sport, playing a musical instrument, cooking).

1.  **What is the skill?**
2.  **How did your physical body and senses help you learn it?** Could you have learned it just by reading about it?
3.  **How does this relate to the challenges of building a Physical AI?**

### *Example Answers for Exercise 1*

- **A Roomba:**
    -   **Brain:** The onboard computer that runs its navigation and cleaning software.
    -   **Body:** The round, plastic chassis.
    -   **Sensors:** Infrared sensors to detect walls and obstacles, "cliff" sensors to avoid falling down stairs, and dirt sensors.
    -   **Actuators:** The motors that drive the wheels and spin the brushes.
